        /* 
        I enjoyed this task! However I did get confused as numbers are 0 indexed so I completed the task as
        if you intended the 3rd parameter to be the n-th element of the sequence rather than the actual index.
        I will also point out here that I have Dyslexia which effects to how I consume infomation and tasks.
        To the best of my skills I have completed the tasks to how I understand them, with commenting displaying my logic
